# Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest

This project is a Python-based machine learning pipeline to predict wine quality using a Random Forest Regressor. The dataset used is the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The workflow includes data loading, feature engineering, transformation, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Requirements:**
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `requests`

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data is downloaded directly from the URL provided in the script.

**URL:** [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv)

## Features

The script includes the following key components:

1. **Data Loading:**
   - The `load_wine_data(url)` function downloads and loads the wine data from the given URL into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - The `engineer_features(df)` function creates new features such as `total_acidity` and `sugar_to_acid_ratio` from existing ones.

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - The `apply_transformations(df, transformations)` function applies specified transformations to certain columns using lambda functions.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - The data is split into training and test sets.
   - Features are scaled using `StandardScaler`.
   - A `RandomForestRegressor` model is trained on the data.
   - Predictions are made on the test set, and evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score are calculated.
   - Feature importances are also computed and displayed.

## Usage

To run the project, execute the `main()` function in the script. The script will:

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Engineer new features.
3. Apply transformations to selected columns.
4. Train a Random Forest model to predict wine quality.
5. Evaluate the model's performance and print basic statistics, metrics, and feature importances.

```bash
python your_script.py
```

**Output:**

- Basic statistics of numeric columns
- Mean Squared Error and R-squared score of the model
- Top 5 important features based on the trained model

## Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated based on:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **R-squared Score:** Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model.
- **Feature Importances:** Indicates the significance of each feature in predicting the target variable.
